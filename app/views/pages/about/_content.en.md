## What is the Energy Transition Model?
The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is an interactive online simulation tool for energy systems. It allows you to explore and quantify potential future energy systems in great detail. The ETM is free to use, [open source](/development), and is available for (EU) countries, municipalities, and many other regions.

## Why use the Energy Transition Model?
The energy transition requires a major re-design of the energy system. Many stakeholders are working on different pieces of this complex puzzle. The ETM allows you to simulate all these pieces in one integral tool, whether they cover different areas, sectors, or carriers. This integration makes it possible remain in charge of the energy transition and exchange valuable insights between stakeholders.

## What to do with the Energy Transition Model?
Use the ETM to get a comprehensive overview of the energy system of your area or country covering demand, supply, emissions, and much more. Choose different technologies, costs, etc. to simulate the impact on the future energy system. By means of a wide variety of KPIâ€™s and (hourly) charts, the ETM will provide you with the quantitative and fact-based feedback to support strategic decision-making.

## Getting started
Choose the area that you are interested in and a year in the future and simply start exploring! The ETM simulates the energy system of your area for the present and your future year. Use the sliders to adjust the energy system. The interactive charts, tables, and dashboard will visualize the impact of your choices on the future.
